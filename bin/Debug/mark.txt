=HTML::WikiConverter=

HTML::WikiConverter is a Perl module for converting HTML to wiki markup for a variety of different wiki engines. Currently, it supports '''many''' dialects:

* DokuWiki
* Kwiki
* MediaWiki
* MoinMoin
* Oddmuse
* PhpWiki
* PmWiki
* SnipSnap
* TikiWiki
* UseMod
* WakkaWiki
* (and others)

I'd ''really'' like to add support for TWiki, but the way it handles '''''bold italics''''' (and possibly other nested elements) is very disappointing.

==Installation==

It's very easy to use HTML::WikiConverter. Grab a copy from your favorite [http://www.cpan.org CPAN mirror] and then run something like this:

   #!/usr/bin/perl -w
   use HTML::WikiConverter;
   my $wc = new HTML::WikiConverter( dialect => 'MediaWiki' );
   print $wc->html2wiki($html);

----

Alternatively, you might want to try HTML::WikiConverter's command line interface; it's a program called <code>html2wiki</code> and it's stored in ''bin/html2wiki''.

==Dialect features==

Unfortunately, I haven't managed to implement every feature of each supported dialect. My initial goal was simply to create a converter for MediaWiki (I am a Wikipediholic, after all :-), but then PhpWiki's Reini Urban suggested that I be more ambitious and provide the dialect interface. And so far I've been really happy with the progress.

==Bugs==

Of course there are always bugs. Luckily, CPAN comes to the rescue again with its [http://rt.cpan.org bug tracking service] for module authors.

But where would we be without bugs? My Pacman frog sure wouldn't be happy without 'em! Do you know what a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacman_frog Pacman frog] is? Or how about an Otago skink? Aplysia californica? Why, these are some of my favorite animals!

==Common features==

===Images===

Many dialects allow embedded images, either from local or remote stores.

===Lists===

Wikis also support lists, even extensively nested ones. Some rely on leading characters to determine nest levels, while others rely on spaces or (egad!) tabs.

* 1
** 1a
** 1b
* 2
** 2a
**# fee
**# fie
**# foe
**#* fum?

Some wikis support definition lists, though they're often used inappropriately (as in MediaWiki, which uses them for indentation).
